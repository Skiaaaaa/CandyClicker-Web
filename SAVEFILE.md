# Candy Clicker Save File

Currently, Candy Clicker Web save files are identical to the save files used by the Windows version in order to maintain compatibility. Documentation can be found in [this file](https://github.com/TollyH/CandyClicker/blob/main/SAVEFILE.md) in the Windows version's repository.
