                        <p class="popup-content candy-clicker-text">Reincarnation allows you to start the game anew with all your stats and the shop reset. In return, you will be granted a multiplier on your candies per second in your new game. You can reincarnate more than once, although each reincarnation will be harder to attain than the last, and you cannot reincarnate in a way that would result in you having a smaller multiplier than you currently have. For more information, click the reincarnation button in the top-left. <img id="reincarnation-help-img" alt="Reincarnation icon" src="images/candy-reincarnate.png"/> Once you have reached the limit of the multiplier you can be given, reincarnating a further time will still cause the game to reset, however you will also lose your CPS multiplier and instead the shop will be upgraded with a multiplier for every 60 overflow stars you currently have.</p>

                        <p class="popup-content candy-clicker-text">After a long time of playing, multiple reincarnations, and reaping the item shop for all it's worth, your candies will likely be growing at an immense pace. You may feel like you've achieved everything possible, but there is still one last trophy for you to add to your collection. Overflow stars. If you manage to make your total candies exceed what the game can handle (a number which is 20 digits long, or over 10 quintillion), then you will be awarded a golden star (<span class="candy-clicker-special-text">★</span>) just above the item shop. Your candies will wrap around back to a lower number, and you can feel a sense of immense pride in knowing that you've gained so much candy that not even a computer can keep count anymore. A new star will be given every single time you manage to reach the limit. While they're not worth anything in the shop, if you've managed to reach this point, buying items probably isn't your highest priority anyway.</p>
